## Tensorflow baseline "Solution template" for challenge `aido1_LF1-v3`

Learning remarks:

For learning you can execute the commands in the Makefile in chronological order. 

For ease of use a Makefile is provided to support all steps in using this template. 
There are two ways of running the makefile. Using docker and without. 
Without docker you will need to have configured the GPU drivers for learning correctly. 

# Docker 

## Installing nvidia-docker-runtime

Type: `make prepare-docker`

This makes sure docker is able to find the nvidia runtime which connects docker to your GPU(s). 

## Learning with docker

Type: `make learn-docker` 

# Regular/without docker

## Dependencies

Create new virtual environment and install necessary dependencies.
Note that ROS needs to be installed additionally. 
Important: Make sure that your CuDNN version matches the tensorflow that will be installed. 
To edit/adjust, change the version in the `install-dependencies` command in the Makefile. 

Type: `install-dependencies`

## Train CNN and freeze TensorFlow graph

Train CNN using the extracted images and velocities from the logs.
This creates an executable network with minimal size. 

Type: `make learn-regular` 

## Copy learned and frozen graph to submission folder

Type: `make regular_copy_for_submission`

The saved file will be used for the following submission step.
